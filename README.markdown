Description
-----------------
Adds support for map markers when an incident has ended.  This depends on the 
endtime module which must be installed.

There is currently no way to associate a specific decay image with a specific
incident.  Instead decay images are associated with categories, and the default
category is the incident marker.  By default this module will try and create a
default category decay image, but this is not possible unless the category icon
is of type PNG.
